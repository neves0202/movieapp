n - s(n),
where s(n) is the restricted divisor function (i.e., the sum of proper divisors of n)
6 = 1 + 2 + 3
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
296 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248

eg
 n = 1  pn = 2  Pn = 6
 n = 2  pn = 3  Pn = 28
 n = 3  pn = 5  Pn = 496
 n = 4  pn = 7  Pn = 8128
 n = 5  pn = 13  Pn = 33550336

According to the Bayesian interpretation of probability, probability theory can be used to evaluate the plausibility of the statement, 'The sun will rise tomorrow.' We just need a hypothetical random process that determines whether the sun will rise tomorrow or not. Based on past observations, we can infer the parameters of this random process, and from there evaluate the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow. - Reference'Wikipedia'", category: "Mathematics"
